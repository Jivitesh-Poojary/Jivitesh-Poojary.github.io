I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with MS in Data Science (Honors) and BTech in Information Technology.

I like to work of complex data analysis processes, understand machine learning algorithms, develop intuition in data modelling and their applications in different domains. I love the whole spectrum of a data science project from understanding the business needs, developing data infrastructure, software engineering, optimizing data pipelines, developing machine learning models and presenting my results to decision makers. 

Having worked in different roles as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer and a Data Analyst, I can anticipate challenges and estimate effort required for a successful data science implementation.
